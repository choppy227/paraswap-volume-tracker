/**
 * this file resolves transactions.
 * it is agnostic to sources, and works with both the graph and covalent.
 * it is also agnostic to chagnes introduced at certain epochs.
 * it bridges the gap between different sources, to ensure the same data
 * is returned either way. for example querying for swaps: the data will
 * come from subgraph before a certain epoch, and so gets augmented
 * with gas used data, whereas later we use covalent which has this already.
 *
 * the caller of functions in this util don't need to care about how the data
 * is resolved, that is the response of the code in this file.
